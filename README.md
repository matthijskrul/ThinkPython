# Learning With Python 3
For storing my Python practice from the textbook *Learning With Python 3*, Rhodes Local Edition, as found on the OpenBookProject: http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html

Unlike the book instructions, however, I use PyCharm for writing the Python code, rather than the suggested PyScripter. It seems to me better to learn directly from a more commonly used IDE.
