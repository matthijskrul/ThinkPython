# Your traffic light controller program has been patented, and youâ€™re about to become seriously rich.
# But your new client needs a change.
# They want four states in their state machine:
# Green, then Green and Orange together, then Orange only, and then Red.
# Additionally, they want different times spent in each state.
# The machine should spend 3 seconds in the Green state, followed by one second in the Green+Orange state,
# then one second in the Orange state, and then 2 seconds in the Red state.
# Change the logic in the state machine.
