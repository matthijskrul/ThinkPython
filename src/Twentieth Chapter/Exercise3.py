# Write a program called alice_words.py that creates a text file named alice_words.txt
# containing an alphabetical listing of all the words,
# and the number of times each occurs, in the text version of Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland.

# The first 10 lines of your output file should look something like this:
#
# Word              Count
# =======================
# a                 631
# a-piece           1
# abide             1
# able              1
# about             94
# above             3
# absence           1
# absurd            2

#  NB: English syntax poses a problem here: omitting ' in the RE Findall method means "Alice's" is treated as
#  one instance of the word "Alice" and one instance of the word "s". It also leads to pseudowords like "doesn".
#  Conversely, including the ' leads to the appearance of many words that open a sequence in quote marks in the text,
#  e.g. " 'besides ". The latter seems more distorting than the former, so I have omitted the (possessive) apostrophe.
